		<h1>Welcome to PartyUP</h1>  
		<p>PartyUP is a nightlife application that allows you to share short, ephemeral videos demonstrating the atmosphere at the venue you are visiting.  If you want to find your next party stop, you can view the videos submitted by other party animals at venues in your area to make an informed choice.  Videos submitted to PartyUP are between 5 and 10 seconds long and may include a note from the submitter providing details about the atmosphere at the venue.  A video is linked to the venue from which it was submitted, usually a bar or nightlife spot.</p> 
		<p>If you aren't out partying just yet, you can share a video on the pregame feed of the city you are in.  This allows you to share your plans with other party people in your area.  You also have the option of looking at the videos from other cities if you think those cities offer fun you are willing to travel for.</p>
	</div>	
	<div id="Hubbing"> 
		<h2 id="CityHub">City Hub</h2>
		<p>The city hub is the center of the PartyUP experience.  The two primary activities of PartyUP, submitting and viewing videos, are initiated from here.  Your location is used to display the content from your area by default, though you can see content from other cities by selecting a city in the <em>Party Place Picker</em>.  To limit data usage, PartyUP does not poll for the freshest data on a regular basis.  You refresh the data on demand by using pull to refresh.</p>
		<image src="images/Venues.png"/>
		<details><summary>1. Party Place Picker</summary><p>Select a sticky city whose content will be displayed in the city hub.  <em>Current Location</em> uses your location to determine the city you are in and shows content for that city.  The available sticky cities are currently curated by the PartyUP development team.</p></details>
		<details><summary>2. About</summary><p>Peruse documentation and acknowledgements.  You can also share and rate PartyUP.</p></details>
		<details><summary>3. Submit Video</summary><p>Initiate the process of submitting a video by bringing up the <a href="#Recording">Recording</a> popover.</p></details>
		<details><summary>4. Venue Filter</summary><p>Filter the list of venues to those containing the string you enter here.  The <em>All Parties Videos</em> feed will be filtered down to those videos recorded at the venues netted by the filter.  The <em>Pregame Videos</em> feed is unaffected by the filter.</p></details>
		<details><summary>5. Local Videos</summary><p>Two special cells are displayed at the top of the city hub, the All Party Videos and Pregame Party Videos cells.  These number of videos available in the feed is indicated by the <a href="#Vitality">vitality icon</a> to the left of the cell.  The number of videos available and the amount of time since the last video was submitted are indicated below the cell label.</p>			
		<ul>
				<li><b>All Party Videos</b> view videos from all of the venues in the city.  Pregame videos are not included in this feed.</li>
				<li><b>Pregame Party Videos</b> view videos that are linked to the selected city rather than a particular venue.  See where others in the city plan to party.</li>
			</ul>
		</details>
		<details><summary>6. Venue Listing</summary><p>Select a venue to see videos recorded there as a series of <a href="#Viewing">viewing</a> pages.  A pale yellow background indicates a promoted venue.  A promotional message may be displayed below the venue name indicating a deal or event.  The number of videos available for a venue is indicated by the vitality icon at the left of the cell.  Below the <a href="#Vitality">vitality</a> icon is an indication of the amount of time since the last video was submitted for the venue.</p></details>
		<details><summary>7. Loading Status</summary><p>PartyUP displays <em>searching</em> and an indeterminate progress indicator in this area while it is fetching the list of nearby venues.</p></details>

		<h2>Video Submission</h2>
		<p>PartyUP uses location services to compile a list of candidate venues you may be attending.  You will not be allowed to begin recording a video until your location has been roughly determined.  Submitting a video involves <a href="#Recording">recording</a> a video and then <a href="#Submitting">submitting</a> the video.</p><p>Videos can't be recorded and submitted until you have agreed to the PartyUP <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.  Until you have agreed to the terms, attempting to record a video will bring up an alert summarizing some of the rules of conduct and allowing options for reading the full terms and accepting the terms.</p>
		<div id="Recorder">
			<h3 id="Recording">Recording</h3>
			<p>Begin the submission process by recording a video that is between 5 and 10 seconds long.  Videos are more expressive of the atmosphere at the venue than photos, so PartyUP only allows submission of videos.</p>
			<image src="images/Recording.png"/>
			<details><summary>1. Cancel</summary><p>Return to the <a href="#CityHub">city hub</a> without submitting a video.  Available even while the determining location heads up display is present.</p></details>
			<details><summary>2. Camera Toggle</summary><p>Toggle between the rear and front cameras.</p></details>
			<details><summary>3. Viewfinder</summary><p>See what your camera is seeing.</p></details>
			<details><summary>4. Record</summary><p>Press and hold to record a video.  Disabled while your location is being determined.  The progress ring changes color from <span style="color:rgb(237,5,138)">pink</span> to <span style="color:rgb(250,168,66)">yellow</span> when the minimum video duration has been recorded.  When the progress ring is full or you release the button after having recorded at least five seconds, PartyUP stops the recording and moves on to <a href="#Submitting">submitting</a> the video.  If you release the record button before five seconds have been recorded, the video is discarded and you may begin recording another video.</p></details>
		</div>
		<div id="Submitter">
			<h3 id="Submitting">Submitting</h3>
			<p>Having <a href="#Recording">recorded</a> your video, you may now share it with other PartyUP users by submitting it.  You have the option of adding a comment describing the fun you are having and you may tweak the venue you are submitting from if we didn't get it quite right using location services.</p>
			<image src="images/Submitting.png"/>
			<details><summary>1. Cancel</summary><p>Return to the <a href="#Recording">recording</a> step, discarding the current video.</p></details>
			<details><summary>2. Submit</summary><p>Share the video with other PartyUp users.</p></details>
			<details><summary>3. Comment</summary><p>Describe the atmosphere at the venue, note the deals, and say hello.  The comment will be displayed in the <a href="#Viewing">viewing pages</a> along with the video.</p></details>
			<details><summary>4. Venue Picker</summary><p>PartyUP makes a guess about the venue you are visiting using your location, but you can override the guess by choosing from a list of nearby venues.  The pregame feed for the city you are in will always be available at the end of the list.</p></details>
			<details><summary>5. Video Preview</summary><p>The video being submitted is played here on a loop for you to review.</p></details>

		<h2 id="Viewing">Video Feed</h2>
		<p>Having selected a feed in the <a href="#CityHub">city hub</a>, you flip through the pages to determine which party is primed for your attendance.  Each page shows you a video and comment submitted by a fellow partier.  Flip through the pages by swiping left or right.  The fresher the video the earlier it appears in the feed. While you are flipping through the feed, newly submitted videos are not inserted. You will have to leave and return to the feed to see new videos.</p> 
		<h3 id="VideoPage">Video Page</h3>
		<p>See a video submitted by a fellow partier.  You can help keep the feed healthy and helpful by voting videos up or down, sharing the video with friends, or reporting the video as inappropriate.</p>
		<image src="images/Viewing.png"/>
		<details><summary>1. Back</summary><p>Return to the <a href="#CityHub">city hub</a>.</p></details>
		<details><summary>2. Venue Label</summary><p>Name of the venue from which the video was submitted.</p></details>
		<details><summary>3. Video</summary><p>What you have come to see, a video submitted by a partier in the field.  The video loops repeatedly.  There is a progress indicator showing how far through the video you are in the top right corner.</p></details>
		<details><summary>4. Timestamp</summary><p>Indicates when the video was submitted. Clicking on the time toggles between relative and short date and time formats.</p></details>
		<details><summary>5. Vote</summary><p>Use the up and down arrows to vote the video up or down.  You get only one vote per video and the vote you have placed is reflected by a grey star appearing behind the appropriate arrow. You can change your vote by tapping the other arrow.  Tapping the arrow with the star will toggle the vote off (making your vote a meh).  The rating of the video appears between the arrows and is determined by subtracting the down from the up votes submitted by users.  If a video's rating hits -5, it is removed from the feed.</p></details>
		<details><summary>6. Share Dots</summary><p>These dots are a gateway to sharing or reporting videos.  A video can be shared via Twitter and Facebook by choosing the appropriate service from the action sheet that tapping the dots brings up.  Choosing the <em>Report Offensive Content</em> option brings up an <em>Offensive Material</em> alert panel with two options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Report Offensive Video</b> flags the video as inappropriate on the PartyUP service.  The video will immediately be removed from your feed, though other users will continue to see it until the threshold of flags submitted has been reached.</li>
				<li><b>Mute Contributor</b> removes all videos <a href="#Submitting">submitted</a> by the contributor of this video from your feed.  This cannot currently be undone without without removing and reinstalling PartyUP, so use it judiciously.</li>
			</details>
		<details><summary>7. Comment</summary><p>A few words from the party animal who <a href="#Submitting">submitted</a> the video. Long comments are scrollable.</p></details>
		<details><summary>8. Flip Page</summary><p>If you are too uncoordinated to swipe through pages, use these handy back and forward buttons to flip through video pages instead.</p></details>
		<h3 id="SharePage">Share Page</h3>
		<p>Flipping past the oldest video in the feed brings you to this bookend page.  It encourages you to recuit your friends as PartyUP users so they can contribute videos for your enjoyment.</p>
		<image src="images/Sharing.png"/>
		<details><summary>1. Back</summary><p>Return to the <a href="#CityHub">city hub</a>.</p></details>
		<details><summary>2. Share PartyUP</summary><p>Brings up an action sheet that provides options to share PartyUP, though not a particular video, via Twitter and Facebook.</p></details>
		<details><summary>3. Flip Page</summary><p>Swiping to flip back to the last video is tiresome, use the indispensable back button instead.</p></details>
