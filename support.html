	<h1>Welcome to PartyUP</h1>  
	<p>PartyUP is a nightlife application that allows you to share short, ephemeral videos demonstrating the atmosphere at the venue you are visiting.  If you want to find your next party stop, you can view the videos submitted by other party animals at venues in your area to make an informed choice.  Videos submitted to PartyUP are between 5 and 10 seconds long and may include a note from the submitter providing details about the atmosphere at the venue.  A video is linked to the venue from which it was submitted, usually a bar or nightlife spot.</p> 
	<p>If you aren't out partying just yet, you can share a video on the pregame feed of the city you are in.  This allows you to share your plans with other party people in your area.  You also have the option of looking at the videos from other cities if you think those cities offer fun you are willing to travel for.</p>
	
	<h2 id="CityHub">City Hub</h2>
	<p>The city hub is the center of the PartyUP experience.  The two primary activities of PartyUP, submitting and viewing videos, are initiated from here.  Your location is used to display the content from your area by default, though you can see content from other cities by selecting a city in the <em>Party Place Picker</em>.  To limit data usage, PartyUP does not poll for the freshest data on a regular basis.  You refresh the data on demand by using pull to refresh.</p>

	<div class="screen_description">
		<details><summary>1. Party Place Picker</summary><p>Select a sticky city whose content will be displayed in the city hub.  <em>Current Location</em> uses your location to determine the city you are in and shows content for that city.

The number of videos available and the amount of time since the last video was submitted are indicated below the cell label.</p>

	<h2>Video Submission</h2>
	<p>PartyUP uses location services to compile a list of candidate venues you may be attending.  You will not be allowed to begin recording a video until your location has been roughly determined.  Submitting a video involves <a href="#Recording">recording</a> a video and then <a href="#Submitting">submitting</a> the video.</p>
	<h3 id="Recording">Recording</h3>
	<p>Begin the submission process by recording a video that is between 5 and 10 seconds long.  Videos are more expressive of the atmosphere at the venue than photos, so PartyUP only allows submission of videos.</p>

	<div class="screen_description">
		<details><summary>1. Cancel</summary><p>Return to the <a href="#CityHub">city hub</a> without submitting a video.  Available even while the determining location heads up display is present.</p></details>
		<details><summary>2. Camera Toggle</summary><p>Toggle between the rear and front cameras.</p></details>
		<details><summary>3. Viewfinder</summary><p>See what your camera is seeing.</p></details>
		<details><summary>4. Record</summary><p>Press and hold to record a video.  Disabled while your location is being determined.  The progress ring changes color from <span style="color:rgb(237,5,138)">pink</span> to <span style="color:rgb(250,168,66)">yellow</span> when the minimum video duration has been recorded.  When the progress ring is full or you release the button after having recorded at least five seconds, PartyUP stops the recording and moves on to <a href="#Submitting">submitting</a> the video.  If you release the record button before five seconds have been recorded, the video is discarded and you may begin recording another video.</p></details>
	</div>
	<h3 id="Submitting">Submitting</h3>
	<p>Having recorded your video, you may now share it with other PartyUP users by submitting it.  You have the option of adding a comment describing the fun you are having and you may tweak the venue you are submitting from if we didn't get it quite right using location services.</p>

		<details><summary>2. Submit</summary><p>Share the video with other PartyUp users.</p></details>
		<details><summary>3. Comment</summary><p>Describe the atmosphere at the venue or the fun you are having.  The comment will be displayed in the <a href="#Viewing">viewing pages</a> along with the video.</p></details>
		<details><summary>4. Venue Picker</summary><p>PartyUP makes a guess about the venue you are at using your location, but you can override the guess by choosing for a list of nearby venues.  The pregame feed for the city you are in will always be present at the end of the list.</p></details>
