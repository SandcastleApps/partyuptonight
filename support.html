	<h1>Welcome to PartyUP</h1>  
	<p>PartyUP is a nightlife application that allows you to share short, ephemeral videos demonstrating the atmosphere at the venue you are visiting.  If you want to plan your next party stop, you can view the videos submitted by other party animals at venues in your area to make an informed choice.  Videos submitted to PartyUP are between 5 and 10 seconds long and may include a note from the submitter providing details about the atmosphere at the venue.  A video is linked to the venue from which it was submitted, usually a bar or nightlife spot.</p> 
	<p>If you aren't out partying just yet, you can share a video on the pregame feed of the city you are in.  This allows you to share your plans with other party people in your area.  You also have the option of looking at the videos from other cities if you think those cities offer fun you are willing to travel for.</p>
	
	<h2>Venue Browsing</h2>
	<p>The venue list is the hub of of the PartyUP experience.  From here you will initiate the two primary activities PartyUP has been created for: 1) submitting videos and 2) viewing the videos submitted by others.</p>
