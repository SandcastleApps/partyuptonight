	<h1>Welcome to PartyUP</h1>  
	<p>PartyUP is a nightlife application that allows you to share short, ephemeral videos demonstrating the atmosphere at the venue you are visiting.  If you want to find your next party stop, you can view the videos submitted by other party animals at venues in your area to make an informed choice.  Videos submitted to PartyUP are between 5 and 10 seconds long and may include a note from the submitter providing details about the atmosphere at the venue.  A video is linked to the venue from which it was submitted, usually a bar or nightlife spot.</p> 
	<p>If you aren't out partying just yet, you can share a video on the pregame feed of the city you are in.  This allows you to share your plans with other party people in your area.  You also have the option of looking at the videos from other cities if you think those cities offer fun you are willing to travel for.</p>
	
	<h2>City Hub</h2>
	<p>The city hub is the center of the PartyUP experience.  The two primary activities of PartyUP, submitting and viewing videos, are initiated from here.  Your location is used to display the content from your area by default, though you can see content from other cities by selecting a city in the <em>Party Place Picker</em>.  To limit data usage, PartyUP does not poll for the freshest data on a regular basis, allowing you to refresh the  data on demand using pull to refresh.</p>

	<h2>Video Submission</h2>
	<p>PartyUP uses location services to compile a list of candidate venues you may be attending.  You will not be allowed to begin recording a video until your location has been roughly determined.  Submitting a video involves <a href="#Recording"> recording</a> a video and then <a href="#Submitting">submitting</a> the video.</p>
